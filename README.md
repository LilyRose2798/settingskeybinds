# Settings Keybinds
Adds key bindings to change Minecraft settings.

This allows settings that were previously only configurable through the settings screen to be changed in game through the use of a key binding that can be set by the user, saving time going back and forth through menus in the case of needing to quickly switch settings back and forth.

Current key bindings include:
- Changing GUI scale (increasing, decreasing, setting to fixed value)
